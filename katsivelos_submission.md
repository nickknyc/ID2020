### Commercial Adoption & Universal Reach
##### Nick Katsivelos nick@katsivelos.com 


Note: This paper is heavily revised in lightof the pubication of Phil Windley's excellent post on 
["Why Companies Need Self-Sovereign Idenity"] (http://www.windley.com/archives/2016/05/why_companies_need_self-sovereign_identity.shtml)
Here is Phil's Summary: 
> All the talk of self-sovereign identity can come off sounding anti-company. The truth is that companies and other organizations stand to gain as much from a self-sovereign identity system as individuals. This post explains how self-sovereign identity systems solve problems for companies, using healthcare as example.

Phil's piece echoes one I had written a few years back on companies apparent love afair with technical approaches to "personalization" and some of the drawbacks companies face when collecting to much, or highly valued personal data titled [Algorithmic Attention: The new face of personal data and why brands need to catalyze the creation of Personal APIs](http://katsivelos.com/2015/10/04/algorithmic-attention/)

What is hidden in both these pieces - and many other pieces on the topics of digital identity and personal data - is that the commercial side of the multisided platform that is identity is not at the table, and most don't even know there is something to discuss. We both call for some brave companies to step forward and add credibility to identity platforms that will put the individual in charge. 

The major issue to address is how to spur adoption and acceptance of this new identity platform, universally. Commercial adoption is critical. Without adoption by the current giants of identity (i.e. Google, Facebook, etc.) - that is they they accept as a Relying Party, this new identity and treat it no differently than their own (no degradation of services). It is in this way we can assure that users will have access to resources on the internet and beyond, regardless of their current national citizenship or brand affiliation. Gaining this adoption will not be easy. Many companies are simply unaware of the issue. Many have built business models that are predicated on control of the users identity. Finally, the value proposition for adoption is simply not compelling enough. 

In considering the Value Proposition for this identity system, another issue arises. Why focus on building an identity system with the sole focus on those "at risk"?  While the need for this type of service is certainly greatly needed for those in refugee situations, an identity service for only those who are in trouble is efectively giving out passports to the land of misfit toys - one that would carry a stigma - or a badge of honor - but one that sets the holder in a particular context in all transactions.  For this reason it seems urgent that the program be aimed not at "creation of a legal digital identity for all individuals at risk." but creation of a legal digital identity for all" - a universal platform - open to all.

Goals:

1. Working with companies to determine value propositions that will drive commercial adoption.

2. Working with leading identity providers to garner their support and willingness to accept this identity as an RP. 

3. Retaining the focus on the goal of addressing the needs of those at risk, insure that the platform is open to all from day one.

Draft Advanced Reading Paper
Digital Identity in Context:
- If someone presents a valid Digital Identity and there is no place to use it, does it have value?
- Understanding Digital Identity (the credential and the related services) operate in a multisided market.
- Digital Identity should allows a person to operate in several spheres:
	- legal systems - international, national or local.
	- NGO's and other charitable service providers.
	- personal communication between individuals, ad hoc groups, and other organziations.
	- access to financial institutions and thus the broader commercial economy, including telecommunictions.
- The key constituent needed for any digital identity platform (distributed or monolithic) to reach critical mass is commerce
- With out commercial adoption, those in psession of a Digital Identity, may have an identity in name only. 
	- Those with a tool to assert legal standing, but no means to pay for goods or services will be, at the end of the day, cold and hungry.
- Therefore, any Digital Identity system needs present a compelling value proposition to the broader commercial economy. For this to happen, the 
identity system needs to be open to all people, and offer a value proposition to them as well. 
	


Let's consider building from the ground up with a simple persona and use case. Through this brief excercise the core components of a successful program will begin to emerge.

Ground Rule One: This will be a human-centered design process.

Ground Rule Two: This solution needs to be Private By Design.

Ground Rule Three: Study of existing tought and code - i.e. What solutions and theories exist that can accelerate the definition process.

Ground Rule Four: The notion of a diital identity hinges on a transaction, one party asserts identity, the counterparty can then validate with a 3rd party. The system needs to be application independent. 
That is, the identity system should not care if it is being used to:
- verify that a person is eligible for relief aid, 
- get access to medical records, 
- prove association with family members, 
- establish a bank account, 
- acquire shelter and food, 
- get on the telecommunictions grid.
