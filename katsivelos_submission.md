Note: This paper is heavily revised in lightof the pubication of Phil Windley's excellent post on 
"Why Companies Need Self-Sovereign Idenity" http://www.windley.com/archives/2016/05/why_companies_need_self-sovereign_identity.shtml
Here is Phil's Summary: All the talk of self-sovereign identity can come off sounding anti-company. The truth is that companies and other organizations stand to gain as much from a self-sovereign identity system as individuals. 
This post explains how self-sovereign identity systems solve problems for companies, using healthcare as example.

Phil's piece echoes one I had written a few years back on companies apparent love afair with technical approaches to "personalization" and some of the drawbacks companies face when collecting to much, or highly valued personal data.

What is hidden in both these pieces - and many other pieces on the topics of digital identity and personal data - is that the commercial side of the multisided platform that is identity is not at the table, and most don't even know there is something to discuss.








Draft Advanced Reading Paper
Digital Identity in Context:
- If someone presents a valid Digital Identity and there is no place to use it, does it have value?
- Understanding Digital Identity (the credential and the related services) operate in a multisided market.
- Digital Identity should allows a person to operate in several spheres:
	- legal systems - international, national or local.
	- NGO's and other charitable service providers.
	- personal communication between individuals, ad hoc groups, and other organziations.
	- access to financial institutions and thus the broader commercial economy, including telecommunictions.
- The key constituent needed for any digital identity platform (distributed or monolithic) to reach critical mass is commerce
- With out commercial adoption, those in psession of a Digital Identity, may have an identity in name only. 
	- Those with a tool to assert legal standing, but no means to pay for goods or services will be, at the end of the day, cold and hungry.
- Therefore, any Digital Identity system needs present a compelling value proposition to the broader commercial economy. For this to happen, the 
identity system needs to be open to all people, and offer a value proposition to them as well. \\
	


Let's consider building from the ground up with a simple persona and use case. Through this brief excercise the core components of a successful program will begin to emerge.

Ground Rule One: This will be a human-centered design process.

Ground Rule Two: This solution needs to be Private By Design.

Ground Rule Three: Study of existing tought and code - i.e. What solutions and theories exist that can accelerate the definition process.

Ground Rule Four: The notion of a diital identity hinges on a transaction, one party asserts identity, the counterparty can then validate with a 3rd party. The system needs to be application independent. 
That is, the identity system should not care if it is being used to:
- verify that a person is eligible for relief aid, 
- get access to medical records, 
- prove association with family members, 
- establish a bank account, 
- acquire shelter and food, 
- get on the telecommunictions grid.
